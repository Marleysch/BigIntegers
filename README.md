Uses class BigInt to allow numbers much much much larger then you can normally have, they are technically characters stored in a vector so you are only limited by how long of a vector you can make.
overloads most of the common operators in order to make them work like normal numbers and some operators such as add can be used with normal integers.
Does not support negative numbers
